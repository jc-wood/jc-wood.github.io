<p class="lead">I remember sitting in front of the family TV sometime back in 1990 or '91 playing various games on the Atari 2600 that my uncle dropped off. I remember being enamored with and utterly confused by a copy of <abbr title="E.T., The Extraterrestrial">E.T.</abbr>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530235165/total-failure-the-worlds-worst-video-game" title="A link to NPR.org">a game so awful millions of copies were buried in the desert</a>. Sometime shortly after, we acquired an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> on which I would play Duck Hunt for <em>hours</em>. Many years later, Mario 64 would blow my mind when I got to play the demo at my local Blockbuster.</p>
<p class="lead">As you can imagine, video games have been a large part of my life. My high school years were probably the peak of gaming. Halo LAN parties and Smash Bros. tournaments were a weekly event for my friends and I.</p>

<h2>These Days...</h2>

<p class="mb-1">These days I spend an inordinate amount of time playing Destiny 2 with my friends and clanmates. My BungieID is <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/User/Profile/3/4611686018490301044?bgn=anxiety" title="Link to Bungie.net">anxiety#3430</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-1">You can also find me on <a href="https://discord.com/users/ifeelanxious" title="Link to Discord user profile.">Discord</a>.</p>
<p class="mb-1">For the past 8 years I've had a pretty regular game of <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons, Fifth Edition">D&D 5e</abbr> going with a group of friends that I met in Knoxville, TN (or through those friends).</p>
<p class="mb-1">I'm interested in trying out the Pathfinder <abbr title="Second Edition">2e</abbr> system in the future.</p>
<p class="mb-1">I'm a huge fan of both <a href="https://critrole.com/" title="A link to Critical Role's webpage">Critical Role</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dimension20show" title="A link to Dimension 20's Youtube page.">Dimension 20</a>.</p>
